One of the reasons scientists study what happened in the past is to understand what may happen now as a result of human-induced climate change. I represented this by illustrating that glaciers are melting and calving, sea levels are risings, and temperatures are increasing.

Whether it becomes one of the great human tragedies of our time, or a model for the future depends on these choices; what happens next is in our hands.\n\nLearn more by following\u00a0@amivitale and\u00a0@friendshipngo.\u00a0@thephotosociety @photography.for.good #water #worldwaterday #conservation #globalwarming #sealevelrise", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CMvAg06jxsF/", "\"2021\"", "Instagram"], [78.93023, 11.987260000000001, "Ny-\u00c5lesund", "Photo by @estherhorvath | The GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences operates a station in Ny-\u00c5lesund, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago, to receive data from research satellites in orbit.

There's nothing new, nothing we don't already know and no clearer warning of the state of our environment and the need for us to change.\n\nWhen I posted about Greece & Turkey a few days ago I was inundated with messages from people telling me about other parts of the world that were facing similar challenges. More people and more places than I could cover in a month's worth of posts on social media. Across the board the planet is warming, our sea levels are rising and extreme weather events are disrupting our lives and natural ecosystems. We are killing ourselves and the plants & animals who share this planet with us.\n\nI also had messages from people telling me that these disasters were man-made, I was an idiot and that climate change was a conspiracy. Whilst there may be evidence that some fires were started by people: melting ice caps, bleaching coral reefs, rising sea levels, terrible flooding, mass death of wildlife and extreme heatwaves are not the actions of one-off individuals. They are the consequence of a global disregard for climate issues that stretches back decades and in this post I talk about 5 key takeaways from the report that I hope people will listen to.\n\nI also acknowledge and have been very open, that as a member of the travel industry, I am a part of the problem. Our industry is estimated to contribute 5-8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, mass over-tourism has led to the ruin of natural habitats, tensions amongst communities and degradation of the environment. But instead of finger-pointing and laying blame, I would like to stand up for changing our industry. For educating ourselves and adopting more sustainable practices when we travel and hope that by sharing the UN report and highlighting @world_wildlife @wwf and @goldstandard4globalgoals we can take action to address the challenges we have created for ourselves.\n\nWhilst the report highlights what we have done wrong, it also highlights that we have a window to course correct. If we act now, by 2050 we can change the path we have set for ourselves \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude4f\n\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1", "https://www.instagram.com/tv/CSeSvpEp00S/", "\"2021\"", "Instagram"], [35.109880000000004, 129.03814000000003, "Busan", "two years ago, a group of builders, engineers, and architects crowded around a table at the United Nations to discuss an ambitious concept: a floating city that could withstand natural disasters, including floods, tsunamis, and Category 5 hurricanes. \n\nBut those visions were notoriously hard to advance \u2014 often because local governments wouldn't sign off on the proposals, citing concerns that there were better uses for the land.\n\nThe UN-backed project cleared that hurdle Thursday, when the city of Busan, South Korea, agreed to host a floating city in collaboration with the project's designer, OCEANIX, and the UN Human Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat).

You can think of the tides as a global standing wave caused by the Moon and the Sun\u2019s gravity tugging on the Earth\u2019s ocean. The Moon is the principal perpetrator of the tides due to its proximity to the Earth, even though its mass is far, far less than the Sun\u2019s. Because the Earth spins around on itself once every day, the tides aren\u2019t actually \u201cgoing in and out\u201d\u2014instead, the Earth is rotating *through* the tidal wave: The tide rises as the Earth spins into the high tide, and the tide goes out as the planet spins away from the gravitational tug-o-war. When the Moon and Sun pull on the ocean in parallel during the full and new moons, we have what are known as \u201cspring tides\u201d\u2014when the pulls are perpendicular, canceling much of their effect out, we have \u201cneap tides.\u201d \u201cKing Tides\u201d are extraordinary spring tides that occur this time of year when the Earth is closest to the Sun in its orbit, and when the Moon is closest to the Earth at the same time. Here\u2019s a shot from last month\u2019s King Tide, showing the ocean a whopping 6.9 feet above the mean tide level and swallowing the Aquarium\u2019s Great Tide Pool into the Monterey Bay. This image is a great visualization of the future of our coastline with rising sea levels due to climate change.  As the ocean heats up, it\u2019s expanding in volume\u2014as it expands, sea levels are rising, and within a few decades what we call a \u201cKing Tide\u201d today will likely be just a plebian average high tide!

Because the Earth spins around on itself once every day, the tides aren\u2019t actually \u201cgoing in and out\u201d\u2014instead, the Earth is rotating *through* the tidal wave: The tide rises as the Earth spins into the high tide, and the tide goes out as the planet spins away from the gravitational tug-o-war. When the Moon and Sun pull on the ocean in parallel during the full and new moons, we have what are known as \u201cspring tides\u201d\u2014when the pulls are perpendicular, canceling much of their effect out, we have \u201cneap tides.\u201d \u201cKing Tides\u201d are extraordinary spring tides that occur this time of year when the Earth is closest to the Sun in its orbit, and when the Moon is closest to the Earth at the same time. Here\u2019s a shot from last month\u2019s King Tide, showing the ocean a whopping 6.9 feet above the mean tide level and swallowing the Aquarium\u2019s Great Tide Pool into the Monterey Bay. This image is a great visualization of the future of our coastline with rising sea levels due to climate change.  As the ocean heats up, it\u2019s expanding in volume\u2014as it expands, sea levels are rising, and within a few decades what we call a \u201cKing Tide\u201d today will likely be just a plebian average high tide!

It lies in the state of South Australia 112 km (70 mi) southwest of Adelaide. Its closest point to the mainland is Snapper Point in Backstairs Passage which is 13.5 km (8.4 mi) from the Fleurieu Peninsula.\n\nOnce occupied by Australian Aborigines, the native population disappeared from the archaeological record when the land became an island following rising sea levels several thousand years ago.

I'm heartbroken for those who've lost love ones. I can't begin to imagine what so many who have lost everything are going through and will be facing in upcoming months as they try to find some semblance of normalcy again. We drove for hours through roads that were more like an ocean to get to the worst affected areas. We didn't know it at the time, but we drove right beside the chemical plant just hours before it blew up. When we dropped our boat in the water early Wednesday morning, dispatch notified that there were over 500 priority rescues waiting for help just in our area. My heart stopped a few times as calls were coming in: families trapped in attics, elderly stuck inside homes with rising water, a mother and her 3 week old baby waiting for rescue from her apartment, and the list goes on! There wasn't time for tears as we went from call to call, house to house, but as I'm heading home right now, it's really hitting me hard just how many people were snatched from the jaws of death! The faces of people standing in chest deep water waving their hands to be rescued by a boat, or lifted out by a chopper is something I'll never forget. Simply put, the devastation is mind-boggling, but the heart of Texas and the tens of thousands of volunteers pouring in from all over the U.S., is nothing short of amazing!  Lately, the news has shown a country inundated with divisiveness, hate, controversy and unrest; but in these past few days (at a time when we absolutely needed unity the most) all I've seen here is Americans working together, giving of themselves, jumping in whenever and wherever needed, and literally putting their lives on the line for complete strangers. A tragedy on a horrific scale has truly brought out the best in so many. In Romans 12, Paul reminds us not to be overcome by evil, but instead to overcome it with good! \nI haven't been able to get Proverbs 24:10-12 off my mind; it says,\n\"If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

Celebrating Earth Day, on April 22nd. \nRecent finding from NASA researchers from JPL ( Jet Propulsion Lab), believe that melting ice is redistributing the planet's weight balance. The Earth has always been heavier at its poles, because large bodies of water are frozen as ice and exert a form of pressure, keeping things reasonably stable. But as the planet warms up and the ice begins to melt, the weight moves from the top and bottom into the middle, creating a \"wobble\" effect.\nSince NASA'S 134-year record of recording global temperatures, January & February 2016 have been the hottest on record. Over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history.\nThe impact of global warming is being felt across the globe with extreme heat waves, devastating  tropical storms, rising sea levels, severe droughts, & wild fires all creating a reality of environmental, economic and health consequences.\n\n#NatGeoEarthDay, #Earthday, #NASA, #JPL, #ClimateChange, #Science, #globalwarming, #recordtemperatures, #co2emissions, #globaltemperatures", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BEg1vC8oVfn/", "\"2016\"", "Instagram"], [54.002430000000004, -124.9942, "British Columbia", "Photo by @james_balog.

In addition, WSL PURE is helping to create the curriculum for programs in ocean studies to be offered for students at Columbia University\u2019s School of Professional Studies.\n\nThis partnership illustrates the World Surf League\u2019s commitment to join forces with world leaders in ocean research and create funding mechanisms for ocean health at a time when the marine environment is at a critical juncture, with rapidly growing issues of pollution, climate change, and overfishing, but diminished government funding for ocean research and little global representation for the oceans themselves.\n\n\u201cAll of us at the World Surf League want to give back to the oceans, and it\u2019s time to get serious,\u201d said Paul Speaker, CEO of the World Surf League. \u201cToday\u2019s launch of WSL PURE and our very special partnership with Columbia University are the first steps in what we hope will become a global movement among our community and beyond, to protect the waters that are both our home and our playing field.  By creating a generation of \u201csurfer scientists,\u201d we aspire to create a voice for the oceans and to inspire and empower our global fan base and partners to become better informed about the issues plaguing the oceans, while providing educational opportunities so that we can become an important part of real-world solutions.\u201d \n\nWSL PURE has contributed an initial $1.5 million in funding that will support Lamont-Doherty scientists as they lead pioneering research in ocean health & ecosystems, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and the role the oceans play in climate change.

Experts warned that the record-breaking heat shows global warming is driving the world\u2019s climate into \u201cuncharted territory\u201d and that it showed the urgency of implementing the carbon-cutting pledges made by the world\u2019s governments in Paris in December. And with 2016 global temperature estimated to beat the current hottest record, this is yet more evidence that the world is warming fast and sea levels on the rise.

Sometimes they come in May, but even when a good rain comes, it just floods. Most of the trees are gone, cut for firewood. The slow burn of climate change makes subsistence farming, already risky business in a hot, arid region, even more of a gamble. Pressures on land and water fuel clashes, big and small. Scholars of migration say millions of people could be displaced around the world in coming decades as rising seas, widening deserts and erratic weather threaten traditional livelihoods.

Carbon levels are officially at 400 parts per million, which scientists warn is beyond repair. \nThe world\u2019s atmospheric carbon concentration has reached an irreversible, critical tipping point of 400 parts per million (ppm). \u201cIt already seems safe to conclude that we won\u2019t be seeing a monthly value below 400 ppm this year\u2014or ever again for the indefinite future,\u201d principal investigator for the Atmospheric Oxygen Research Group at Scripps Institution of Oceanography Ralph Keeling said last week. Scientists have long warned about the dangers of reaching this critical concentration which include cataclysmic events such as rapidly rising sea levels, food chain disruption, ocean acidification, and extinction.

In fact, during the summer, Arctic sea ice covers less than 40% of the area it once did in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the worlds ice and fresh water is located in Antartica and Greenland. 75% of the worlds fresh water is located in these regions, and if all of it were melted, global sea levels would rise by about 75 meters.

IceBridge utilizes a highly specialized fleet of research aircraft and the most sophisticated suite of innovative science instruments ever assembled to characterize annual changes in thickness of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets. In addition, IceBridge collects critical data used to predict the response of Earth\u2019s polar ice to climate change and resulting sea-level rise.

Together with NASA\u2019s existing fleet of satellites, airborne missions, researchers, and the unique platform of the International Space Station (ISS), these new missions will help answer some of the critical challenges facing our planet today and in the future.\n\n#earthrightnow #nasa #iss #iheartnasa\n\nImage Credit: NASA/NOAA/GSFC/Suomi NPP/VIIRS/Norman Kuring", "https://www.instagram.com/p/nqqQj1Pqcw/", "\"2014\"", "Instagram"], [NaN, NaN, NaN, "Scientific name:  Dugong dugon.

A portion of Highway 11 (Mamalahoa) was shut down Saturday from the Honu'apo lookout near mile marker 57 to mile marker 58 after heavy rainfall overnight caused flash flooding at Ka'awa Flats in Na'alehu. Officials and local residents say the area is prone to flooding whenever there is a significant amount of rain.

Insights from these space-based views help answer some of the critical challenges facing our planet today and in the future: climate change, sea level rise, freshwater resources, and extreme weather events. NASA Earth research also yields many down-to-earth benefits, such as improved environmental prediction and natural hazard and climate change preparedness.\n\nFor more information on getting involved in the #GlobalSelfie Earth Day event, visit: http://www.nasa.gov/globalselfie\n\n#selfie #nasa #space #earthday #earthrightnow\"", "https://www.instagram.com/p/nF11Y8PqaC/", "\"2014\"", "Instagram"], [47.50892, -120.49956999999999, "Washington", "Yet we have Soldiers standing in formation without uniforms...

Addressing climate change will have a direct impact on the futures of all girls. \nFollow @amivitale for more photos celebrating the hope and beauty in the world. @thephotosociety @rippleeffectimages #girls #climatechange #india #empathyiseverything", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CGe1kNHAmW1/", "\"2020\"", "Instagram"], [-65.16856, -64.13229000000001, "Petermann Island", "Photo by Michaela Skovranova @mishkusk // Sponsored by @OPPO // Red algae thrive on Petermann Island.

This tiny little baby girl had made me feel complete and had filled something in my soul I didn\u2019t know I needed. I felt such an urgency to protect her and soak up every ounce of her as she will be my last baby. Over the past few days I have been looking at her apologising for bringing her into this world at such an intense time. That her short little time on earth has been overcome with this madness. But then I started thinking. Maybe the world after all of this is over will be a better one, maybe the air will be clearer, the oceans and skies less congested. Perhaps we will all be kinder to one another, more patient. That when she looks out our windows she wont worry about rising seas and one day the idea that the planet was dying is so far forgotten. Yesterday we finally buried our darling Pumpkin, we planted an avocado tree, along with her ashes, that grew from the seed of the last avocado she ate before she passed away. One day my girls will get to enjoy the avocados and they will hear stories about how her crazy parents rescued and housed an abandoned raccoon. And the tree will grow and thrive because the world will have learnt a valuable lesson from this time in our history. We came into this together and we will get through this together.

Already, droughts regularly threaten food crops across the West, while destructive floods inundate towns and fields from the Dakotas to Maryland, collapsing dams in Michigan and raising the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Rising seas and increasingly violent hurricanes are making thousands of miles of shoreline along the coasts nearly uninhabitable.\n\nFor years, Americans have avoided confronting these changes in their own backyards.

Moulins are giant, vertical caves that funnel meltwater from the ice sheet surface to its bed. Meltwater squirts out of the base of moulins to lubricate the contact between the ice and the underlying landscape,\u00a0causing the ice sheet to speed up in summer. Daily maximum ice velocities can double or triple during summer before winter's freezing temperatures shut down melting and the ice slows down. As the arctic warms, both the length of the meltseason and the area of the ice sheet that melts each summer are increasing and new moulins are likely forming in areas of the ice sheet that have never had them.

Through my studies as an environmental science & policy student, I was startled to see how much someone's cultural identity could actually increase their risk of being exposed to environmental hazards. Black and brown communities in the country faced disproportionate exposure to poor air and water quality. Small Island Nations globally were facing the threat of sea level rise and BIPOC communities on average had less access to green spaces to recreate. While the data was very clear, at times I didn't feel support from the environmental community when it came to acknowledging social injustice as it relates to my identity and I felt unheard. This is why I decided to define the term \"Intersectional Environmentalism\" - a type of environmentalism that identifies the ways in which injustices happening to marginalized communities and the earth are interconnected, without silencing or minimizing social inequality. By acknowledging both social and environmental injustice as environmentalists, I think we really have the power to create change. \nTo learn more, Alex and I spoke about intersectional environmentalism this morning in an IG TV episode posted on his profile. You can also learn more about my new organization @intersectionalenvironmentalist , created by an amazing collective of eco-activists, on the instagram page or website intersectionalenvironmentalist.com (link in Alex\u2019s profile.)

If this rate climbs up to 6 mm per year, scientists believe that the existing as well as new mangroves will stop growing.\n\nScientists analysed two scenarios in the study, one wherein the carbon emission limits were met as per the 2015 Paris Agreement, and the other with higher carbon emissions, states a Reuters report.\n\nMangroves are known to protect the planet\u2019s coastlines from intense storms, tsunamis and even the rising seas. Their presence along the coastline also proves to be a nursery for growing fish.\n\nBut their most important plus is the fact that they act as a carbon sink for the planet. Horton mentions that if the mangroves are lost, \u201cit would mean that there is even more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing even higher temperatures and even higher rates of sea level rise.\u201d While a quarter of the world\u2019s mangroves already lost, their current rate of destruction is still apace at rates of three to five times higher than the other forests.", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CBLxVjkoArt/", "\"2020\"", "Instagram"], [23.0022, 89.002, "Ganges Delta", "Sea-level rise affects us all\ud83c\udf0a\n\nCountries like Bangladesh & India are home to the greatest number of people who today live on land that could be threatened by permanent inundation by 2100. \n.\nMonitoring sea-level rise is the job of the @copernicus_eu Sentinel-6Michael Freilich \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f, set to be launched on 10 Nov.\n.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8This image features the Ganges Delta \u2013 the world\u2019s largest river delta.

I thought of the forces of nature that gave it form; how its journey began high on the mountain slopes where countless winters\u2019 worth of snow rose higher and higher, pressing the ice beneath it into a slab of brilliant cerulean. I imagined the day it finally broke free from its icy palisade and slid down to the sea as a fully formed iceberg, a single azure flame voyaging out on the line between sea and sky. It would travel the ocean for months, maybe years, until it slipped once more into briny oblivion, perhaps waiting to be rebirthed in the changing seasons. I found myself hoping that despite the warming waters and rising seas, it would take form and return to Russia\u2019s frozen shores again someday.

As the waves lapped gently at my legs, I sank into the plush sand of the seafloor and was careful not to disturb a single grassy blade. Seagrass beds support a vibrant community of underwater creatures including sea turtles and many species of fish. They act as powerful carbon sinks, stabilize the ocean floor against erosion, and help filter out toxins from pollution with the help of mangroves and marshes. They also serve as a critical indicator of our ocean\u2019s health and are highly sensitive to changes in water quality. Without healthy seagrass, our coastlines lose their resilience against rising sea levels and the increasing threat of powerful storm surges.

Now the island is gone, wiped out by Hurricane Walaka. East Island was one of the Hawaiian Leeward Islands, an archipelago of atolls that stretches for a thousand miles in the Central Pacific. Even though they are mere feet above sea level, they are home to millions of seabirds and to endangered green sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals. All of them are now threatened by the extreme weather episodes and the sea level rise caused by climate change. The aerial view in this set of photos shows Tern Island in the French Frigate Shoals.

Scientists are predicting that climate change could lead to a rise in sea levels that would flood at least 17 percent of #Bangladesh and create around 20-35 million #refugees by 2050. They say the monsoon rains in the region are concentrating into a shorter period, causing a cruel combination of more extreme floods and longer periods of drought. In the capital of #Dhaka, the impact is already being felt, with some half a million migrants arriving in the city each year. These \u201cclimate change refugees\u201d are pouring mostly into squalid slums and the biggest reason for moving is environmental degradation. \nThe situation is at once ironic and unjust.The poorest are the most affected by climate change but they are the least responsible for it.

More than half of the entire population used it. But now it\u2019s gone. Hurricane Walaka recently wiped it out. East Island was situated in the French Frigate Shoals, which is one of the Hawaiian Leeward Islands, an archipelago of atolls that stretches for a thousand miles in the Central Pacific. Even though they are mere feet above sea level, they are home to millions of seabirds and to endangered green sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals. All of them are now threatened by the extreme weather episodes and the sea level rise caused by climate change. The aerial view in this set of photos shows Tern Island, also in the French Frigate Shoals. It has an airstrip built in World War Two to serve military planes.

Every four years, a dominant run occurs, which sees millions of sockeye salmon swim approximately 500 kilometres from the ocean back to the river where they were born. This long, amazing, journey against the current culminates with the fish spawning and then dying after they've completed their life cycle. The bodies that aren't eaten by predators will naturally decompose and become part of the forest. This year, their journey has been especially hard, since low waters have meant a lot of fish were not able to make it upstream and died before they could spawn. Additionally, the numbers of returning fish have been low, due to issues such as overfishing, rising water temperatures, and disease from fish farms. We remain concerned about the future of this and other wild salmon populations and will continue to follow this issue.

Every 4 years, a dominant run occurs, which is supposed to see millions of fish simultaneously making their way from the ocean up the river, to spawn and complete their life cycle. This year was meant to be one of those dominant runs, but what we witnessed was far from that. This year\u2019s total return numbers won\u2019t be known until early 2019, but they\u2019re expected to be lower than those from 2014, which saw 700,000 fish. This number may seem high, but don't let it fool you; the historical decrease in the number of fish reaching the river to spawn has been dramatic. First Nations elders and locals to the area can recall a time when they could only see red in the river, as millions of salmon surged upstream to spawn. And that is no exaggeration. Back in 1974, the average return for sockeye salmon in the Lower Adams River was 6.7 million. This year the waters should have turned red, but didn't. An expected return of less than 700,000 is nothing short of alarming. There are several issues likely behind these low numbers: open-net Atlantic salmon fish farms spreading disease to wild salmon, climate change rising water temperatures so fish can't survive, low water levels making the struggle for these fish to swim upstream even harder, and the harvest of millions of fish from the ocean before they're able to spawn. Last year, a federal committee on endangered wildlife in Canada found eight populations of Fraser River - Adams parent river - sockeye salmon are in decline, and should be legally protected under species at risk legislation. Meanwhile, the Department for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) continues to ignore the situation, putting the economic needs of commercial fisheries ahead of the rest of the ecosystem, threatening the future of our wild stocks.

This humble house, the Knap of Howar, is thus not some remote insignificant artifact in the North Sea but central to the human story that flourished after the retreat of the ice age \u2014 that\u2019s our story. Many of these sites are now threatened by the rising seas that will become common in coming decades. When the rain arrived and beat down on us we sheltered in the tunnel that connects the two houses.

I\u2019m based in Miami, and my work uses tools and strategies related to digital media and commercial photography to examine notions of environmentalism, consumerism and the picturesque. In general, my work is in conversation with the tradition of landscape photography, while rethinking the consumable products it generates.\n-\nThis image is from my series FloodZone, an expansive photographic project reflecting and responding to the problem of rising sea levels.

In the past decades, the sea has been rising and submerging many of the small town. Its dunes conceal about 400 buildings, including public constructions, residential blocks, hotels, a gas station and a church. A group of factors such as rising sea levels and disastrous human interventions along the riverbed, made Atafona the biggest case of sea erosion in Brazil. 2015 \u2013 ongoing.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThe six selected South American talents of the second edition of the 6x6 Global Talent Program are taking over our feed for the next two weeks!

They support a rich biodiversity and provide a valuable nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Mangroves also act as a form of natural coastal defense against storm surges, tsunamis, rising sea levels and erosion. Their soils are highly effective carbon sinks, sequestering vast amounts of carbon.\n\nYet mangroves are disappearing three to five times faster than overall global forest losses, with serious ecological and socio-economic impacts. Current estimates indicate that mangrove coverage has been divided by two in the past 40 years.\n\nUNESCO is engaged deeply in supporting the conservation of mangroves, while advancing the sustainable development of their local communities. The inclusion of mangroves in Biosphere Reserves, World Heritage sites and UNESCO Global Geoparks contributes to improving the knowledge, management and conservation of mangrove ecosystems throughout the world.\n\nThe International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 2015 and celebrated each year on 26 July, aims to raise awareness of the importance of mangrove ecosystems as \u201ca unique, special and vulnerable ecosystem\" and to promote solutions for their sustainable management, conservation and uses.\n\n#MangroveDay #Nature #Ecosystem #MakeOurPlanetGreatAgain #ClimateChange #SustainableDevelopment #SDGs #BiosphereReserves #Earth #GlobalGoals", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BlszvNZHH2E/", "\"2018\"", "Instagram"], [23.83513, 90.2582, "Dhaka Division", "Photo by @amivitale.

He said: \u201cKing tides combined with strong winds wreak havoc among our people\u2026 in some parts whole villages have had to relocate.\u201d Tong urged countries to use Kiribati\u2019s plight as inspiration to develop an ambitious deal to radically cut greenhouse gas emissions and avert further consequences from rising temperatures. @natgeo @ciriljazbec #Kiribati #climate #change #rising #seas", "https://www.instagram.com/p/4kZ0q0IVWM/", "\"2015\"", "Instagram"], [37.1969, -100.84959, "Seward County", "Photo by @edkashi/@viiphoto: A boat with tourists sails past glaciers near Seward, #Alaska on Aug. 2, 2015.

It requires a lot of driving because the weather patterns are constantly shifting. We follow the tornadoes and get as close as safely possible to share images with the world that are far too dangerous for the inexperienced person to capture. I started doing more travel photography because I had become dependent on storms and while there are seasons for them, it felt almost as rewarding to take a beautiful photo in Bora Bora or some other exotic location. I grew up in the Florida Keys as an only child with lots of spare time so when I was 8 years old I turned to photography. I started practicing with the storms in Florida. I photographed my first hurricane at the age of 9; I captured another one when I was 12. I soon learned the damage that hurricanes could cause and I wanted to be more involved and warn people about the dangers. The combination of my photography skills and storm interest led me to becoming a professional storm photographer. I filmed Hurricane Katrina and we recorded the highest storm surge in the world. I invented an extreme camera housing called the \u201cTheiss Device\u201d, which was engineered to get a camera into the eye of a storm and survive. I put the camera in the lobby of a hotel during Katrina but had to flee because of rising water heights. The entire first floor of the hotel was gutted with nothing but concrete walls left standing.

Reefs are millions of years old and can be thought of like the rain forests our Ocean, containing fragile ecosystems that keep all sea life in our biosphere thriving. Pollution, oil spills, sewage, over fishing all damage reefs, but rising water temps from climate change are the most dangerous culprit to our worlds reefs today.  How can we help?\nStay informed \nRecycle\nDon't pollute our oceans\nBe careful snorkeling and diving\nSupport conservation groups\nSpeak your mind\nAnd cutting down our chemical use are some direct ways to start.

Until we\u2019re aware of our #future, we can\u2019t deal with it.\u201d Mass species #extinction, extreme #weather events, dry spells & fires are climate change impacts which are happening now. A warmer atmosphere & warmer oceans can lead to stronger storms, he explained. #Superstorm #Sandy, for example, remained a hurricane all the way up the Eastern seaboard to #NewYork because Atlantic waters were abnormally warm. \u201cIt will happen faster than you think,\u201d he said. If major coastal cities become \u201cdysfunctional\u201d because of sea level rise, as he believes is possible, the global economy could be in peril of #collapse.\n\nIt is therefore imperative to stop using coal, oil and gas as energy sources now. \u201cWe\u2019ve already burned as much as we can afford,\u201d he said. Fossil fuels already burned will continue to have impacts, because the climate system \u201chas inertia.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve only felt the warming for half of the gases that are up there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe use of fossil fuels is still on the rise in spite of the dangers, he said, because governments subsidize them and don\u2019t make companies bear the real costs to society. The only viable way to make the price of fossil fuels \u201chonest,\u201d in his opinion, is to implement a \u201cfee and dividend\u201d system. \"I think this may be our best chance to force the government to do its job,\u201d he said. \nMost of the elders participating in Grandparents Climate Action Day probably won\u2019t live to see the worst effects of #climatechange, yet they were eager to learn about the #earth future generations will inherit.

(That they really don\u2019t need)\nScience clearly tells us that we must keep two thirds of fossil fuels in the ground if we are to curb carbon emissions and stay below a 2 degrees rise in temperature. However this is an industry that has no intention of stopping, an industry who have consistently focused on corporate profits and short term gain at the expense of our future. Just 25 companies are responsible for 50% of carbon emissions. Forget changing your light bulbs and having shorter showers, these are the real climate criminals. \nClimate change is the greatest social justice issue of our time. 99% of climate related deaths occur in the world\u2019s least developed countries even though those countries contribute to just 1% of emissions. The future will see extreme weather patterns, sea level rise, mass migration and disease. This may sound alarmist, and I wish it was, but it is unfortunately fact. Climate change is not something happening in the future, it is happening now, it is not just an urgent issue... it is an emergency.\nWhilst we can\u2019t choose whether we will be affected by climate change (most of us will), we can choose whether we will be bystanders. \ud83d\udcf7:@extinctionrebellion", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuhP6ifnI4T/", "\"2019\"", "Instagram"], [NaN, NaN, NaN, "Photo by Adam Ferguson @adamfergusonstudio I Local children play at the waters edge on Beniamina Island in Choiseul Province, Solomon Islands in June 2018.

Barcelona, 2100. \ud83e\udd2f\nOur global sea levels have risen 16-21cm since 1900 but new studies reveal an accelerating rise. This serious acceleration is due to global warming that drives: the melting of ice sheets and thermal expansion (when water warms it increases in size). Whilst projecting future sea level rise is challenging, as our climate system is so complex, climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st Century. Just a few painful impacts of such a rise include coastal storm-surge flooding, coastal erosion and changes in water quality. This could devastate the lives of the millions of people who live in low-lying areas around the world. This is a terrible injustice because we don\u2019t all contribute to this problem equally and often those who have contributed the least will suffer the most. This is unfair and the most pressing task is to address this injustice. We must reduce future greenhouse emissions as well as address consequences of carbon already emitted. Individual action is crucial: the decisions we make everyday have real consequences for our planet. We can all make small changes, to address how unevenly we contribute to the problem, that make big differences. Some of the best things you can do are reduce the amount of meat and dairy you eat, reduce the number of flights you take and reduce the amount of power you use.

Barcelona.  2100.\n\nPhotos @ianharper & edit @steffeneisenacher\n\nOur global sea levels have risen 16-21cm since 1900 but new studies reveal an accelerating rise.  This serious acceleration is due to global warming that drives: the melting of ice sheets and thermal expansion (when water warms it increases in size). Whilst projecting future sea level rise is challenging, as our climate system is so complex, climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st Century.  Just a few painful impacts of such a rise include coastal storm-surge flooding, coastal erosion and changes in water quality.  This could devastate the lives of the millions of people who live in low-lying areas around the world.  This is a terrible injustice because we don\u2019t all contribute to this problem equally and often those who have contributed the least will suffer the most.  This is unfair and the most pressing task is to address this injustice.  We must reduce future greenhouse emissions as well as address consequences of carbon already emitted.  Individual action is crucial: the decisions we make everyday have real consequences for our planet.  We can all make small changes, to address how unevenly we contribute to the problem, that make big differences.  Some of the best things you can do are reduce the amount of meat and dairy you eat, reduce the number of flights you take and reduce the amount of power you use.

What does this mean for us? From The Verge: \u201cThe Arctic is a natural freezer,\u201d says Michael Mann, a climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University \u201cJust like you\u2019d be concerned if all of the ice in your freezer melted, so should you be concerned about the loss of Arctic sea ice.\u201d The changes that are happening in the Arctic affect our entire planet because it\u2019s all one interconnected system, and the vanishing ice is already having ripple effects down south. Among them: faster global warming, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather/natural disasters. Melt rates are accelerating, and that poses a serious threat to anyone living on the coast. In the US, that\u2019s about 40 percent of the population. Residents in Florida, New Jersey, and Maryland are already experiencing more flooding and it\u2019s only getting worse. \u201cCertain cities will have to be abandoned,\u201d Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge, says. The good news is we still have some time to change our ways and be more eco-friendly before we reach a point of no return, which scientists believe will be in the next decade or so.

Barcelona, 2100. \ud83e\udd2f\nOur global sea levels have risen 16-21cm since 1900 but new studies reveal an accelerating rise. This serious acceleration is due to global warming that drives: the melting of ice sheets and thermal expansion (when water warms it increases in size). Whilst projecting future sea level rise is challenging, as our climate system is so complex, climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st Century. Just a few painful impacts of such a rise include coastal storm-surge flooding, coastal erosion and changes in water quality. This could devastate the lives of the millions of people who live in low-lying areas around the world. This is a terrible injustice because we don\u2019t all contribute to this problem equally and often those who have contributed the least will suffer the most. This is unfair and the most pressing task is to address this injustice. We must reduce future greenhouse emissions as well as address consequences of carbon already emitted. Individual action is crucial: the decisions we make everyday have real consequences for our planet. We can all make small changes, to address how unevenly we contribute to the problem, that make big differences. Some of the best things you can do are reduce the amount of meat and dairy you eat, reduce the number of flights you take and reduce the amount of power you use. Every day makes a difference, every meal makes a difference.\nPhoto by @ianharper & edit @steffeneisenacher\n#climatechange #climatecrisis #climateemergency #barcelona #sealevel #sealevelrise #climate #sea #climatefuture #climateaction #climateactionnow", "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByD2GULAySP/", "\"2019\"", "Instagram"], [NaN, NaN, NaN, "BBC Earth contributor  @drvivcumming is photographer on board a research vessel in Antarctica surrounded by icebergs. \u201829 Antarctic scientists are together on the scientific drilling vessel the @joides_resolution, drilling into the Earth's crust in the Amundsen Sea to get the first continuous long-term sediment record of the history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

The September 20 strike will kick off a week of actions capped by another strike on September 27. We urge you to take a stand with us. Together, let\u2019s show our politicians we are serious about the fight against climate change. Join us, @FransLanting and @ChristineEckstrom, in this effort, and check the link in my bio to find out about events in your community and how you can join the strike.\n\n@thephotosociety @leonardodicaprio @gretathunberg #Antarctica #Iceberg #ClimateStrike #ClimateCrisis #naturenow #strikewithus #globalwarming #savetheplanet #gretathunberg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2m7A4-Fypg/", "\"2019\"", "Instagram"], [-42.9996, 67.0071, "Territory of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands", "This 650m deep tunnel was drilled as part of the Filchner Ice Shelf System project (FISS) in order to gather study how this Antarctic ice shelf could respond to a warmer future, and the effects of sea level rise over the next fifty years. \nTo do this, a measuring device was lowered into the hole to collect data on the temperatures and ocean currents beneath the shelf.

Barcelona. 2100.\n-\nOur global sea levels have risen 16-21cm since 1900 but new studies reveal an accelerating rise. This serious acceleration is due to global warming that drives: the melting of ice sheets and thermal expansion (when water warms it increases in size). Whilst projecting future sea level rise is challenging, as our climate system is so complex, climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st Century. Just a few painful impacts of such a rise include coastal storm-surge flooding, coastal erosion and changes in water quality. This could devastate the lives of the millions of people who live in low-lying areas around the world. This is a terrible injustice because we don\u2019t all contribute to this problem equally and often those who have contributed the least will suffer the most. This is unfair and the most pressing task is to address this injustice. We must reduce future greenhouse emissions as well as address consequences of carbon already emitted. Individual action is crucial: the decisions we make everyday have real consequences for our planet. We can all make small changes, to address how unevenly we contribute to the problem, that make big differences. Some of the best things you can do are reduce the amount of meat and dairy you eat, reduce the number of flights you take and reduce the amount of power you use.

These extra ordinary ecosystems contribute to the well being, food security, and protection of coastal communities worldwide. They support a rich biodiversity and provide a valuable nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Mangroves also act as a form of natural coastal defense against storm surges, tsunamis, rising sea levels and erosion. Their soils are highly effective carbon sinks, sequestering vast amounts of carbon.\n\nYet, mangroves are disappearing three to five times faster than overall global forest losses, with serious ecological and socio-economic impacts. Current estimates indicate that mangrove coverage has been divided by two in the past 40 years.\n\nUNESCO is engaged deeply in supporting the conservation of mangroves, while advancing the sustainable development of their local communities. The inclusion of mangroves in Biosphere Reserves, World Heritage sites and UNESCO Global Geoparks contributes to improving the knowledge, management and conservation of mangrove ecosystems throughout the world.\n\nJoin us in celebrating Mangrove Day and let's remember that protecting our mangroves is essential to the planet's future.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9 rcphotography \ud83d\udcf8\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#MangroveDay #Nature #Ecosystem #MakeOurPlanetGreatAgain #ClimateChange #SustainableDevelopment #SDGs #BiosphereReserves #Earth #GlobalGoals #WorldHeritage #Unesco #Mangroves", "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0YCPg2CYya/", "\"2019\"", "Instagram"], [24.0005, 88.0099, "West Bengal", "Meet the iconic Bengal tiger - the most populous but endangered tiger subspecies in the world.\n\nThese tigers can be found in\nthe mangroves of the Sundarbans!\nThe Sundarbans forests, the largest mangrove forests worldwide, are known for their wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the Bengal tiger and other threatened species.

Barcelona.  2100.\n\nPhotos @ianharper & edit @steffeneisenacher\n\nOur global sea levels have risen 16-21cm since 1900 but new studies reveal an accelerating rise.  This serious acceleration is due to global warming that drives: the melting of ice sheets and thermal expansion (when water warms it increases in size). Whilst projecting future sea level rise is challenging, as our climate system is so complex, climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st Century.  Just a few painful impacts of such a rise include coastal storm-surge flooding, coastal erosion and changes in water quality.  This could devastate the lives of the millions of people who live in low-lying areas around the world.  This is a terrible injustice because we don\u2019t all contribute to this problem equally and often those who have contributed the least will suffer the most.  This is unfair and the most pressing task is to address this injustice.  We must reduce future greenhouse emissions as well as address consequences of carbon already emitted.  Individual action is crucial: the decisions we make everyday have real consequences for our planet.  We can all make small changes, to address how unevenly we contribute to the problem, that make big differences.  Some of the best things you can do are reduce the amount of meat and dairy you eat, reduce the number of flights you take and reduce the amount of power you use.
