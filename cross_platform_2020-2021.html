Females have been described as \u201csupermoms\u201d because they handle all egg and chick-rearing \u2013 and can bring food back to their chicks 100x each day! \ud83e\udeb6\n\nBut these beloved birds are threatened by climate change, including sea level rise. Rising sea levels result in salt marsh hay flooding more often and getting replaced with other grasses. This can cause salt marsh sparrow eggs and young chicks to drown when marshes flood more than once a month. \n\n\u201cOur goal is to create a healthy and resilient marsh that not only benefits saltmarsh sparrows but also lots of other wildlife and people who depend on salt marsh habitat, says\u201d @USFWS Wildlife biologist Nancy Pau. \n\nPau is working to conserve the imperiled salt marsh sparrow at Parker River National Wildlife Refuge in Massachusetts through partnerships, science, innovation and nature-based solutions.\n\nImages by:\nPeter Paton\nNancy Pau/USFWS\n\n#AAPI #AANHPI #USFWS", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CeHiNw1hmac/", "\"2022\"", "Instagram"], [19.08083, 72.88561, "Mumbai", "A new analysis on the impact of sea level rise on coastal Indian cities has revealed that some critical properties and road networks in #Mumbai, #Kochi, #Mangalore, #Chennai, #Vishakhapatnam, and #Thiruvananthapuram will be submerged by 2050.\n\nIn Mumbai, around 998 buildings and 24km of road length will be affected by potential sea-level rise by 2050. \n\nRead more - Link in bio\n.\n#climatechange #globalwarming", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CcEvagnqzUS/", "\"2022\"", "Instagram"], [33.589529999999996, 133.37527, "Kochi Prefecture", "A new analysis on the impact of sea level rise on coastal Indian cities has revealed that some critical properties and road networks in #Mumbai, #Kochi, #Mangalore, #Chennai, #Vishakhapatnam, and #Thiruvananthapuram will be submerged by 2050.\n\nIn Mumbai, around 998 buildings and 24km of road length will be affected by potential sea-level rise by 2050. \n\nRead more - Link in bio\n.\n#climatechange #globalwarming", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CcEvagnqzUS/", "\"2022\"", "Instagram"], [12.925229999999999, 74.85903, "Mangalore", "A new analysis on the impact of sea level rise on coastal Indian cities has revealed that some critical properties and road networks in #Mumbai, #Kochi, #Mangalore, #Chennai, #Vishakhapatnam, and #Thiruvananthapuram will be submerged by 2050.\n\nIn Mumbai, around 998 buildings and 24km of road length will be affected by potential sea-level rise by 2050. \n\nRead more - Link in bio\n.\n#climatechange #globalwarming", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CcEvagnqzUS/", "\"2022\"", "Instagram"], [13.09791, 80.27043, "Chennai", "A new analysis on the impact of sea level rise on coastal Indian cities has revealed that some critical properties and road networks in #Mumbai, #Kochi, #Mangalore, #Chennai, #Vishakhapatnam, and #Thiruvananthapuram will be submerged by 2050.\n\nIn Mumbai, around 998 buildings and 24km of road length will be affected by potential sea-level rise by 2050. \n\nRead more - Link in bio\n.\n#climatechange #globalwarming", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CcEvagnqzUS/", "\"2022\"", "Instagram"], [19.07383, 72.88381, "Mumbai", "A new analysis on the impact of sea level rise on coastal Indian cities has revealed that some critical properties and road networks in #Mumbai, #Kochi, #Mangalore, #Chennai, #Vishakhapatnam, and #Thiruvananthapuram will be submerged by 2050.\n\nIn Mumbai, around 998 buildings and 24km of road length will be affected by potential sea-level rise by 2050. \n\nRead more - Link in bio\n.\n#climatechange #globalwarming", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CcEvagnqzUS/", "\"2022\"", "Instagram"], [27.5016, 84.67150000000001, "Royal Chitwan National Park", "Just In: Chitwan National Park will close all kinds of activities like Jungle safari, Jungle walk in CNP from Ashar 1 until further notice due to the possible effects of monsoon like falling trees, rising water levels and so on that may affect the visitors and tourists.\n\nPic. @rawal_binay", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CetefKnKHqL/", "\"2022\"", "Instagram"], [25.879730000000002, -80.12280000000001, "Surfside", "Last summer\u2019s collapse in Surfside, Florida, exposed a startling truth: there are thousands of aging condo buildings that could be next.

So let's take a real action, by addressing climate change, we can build a sustainable world for everyone. But we need to act now.\n\nDoing nothing will end up costing us a lot more than if we take actions now that will lead to more jobs, greater prosperity, and better lives for all while reducing green-house gas emissions and building climate resilience.\n\n#LetTheEarthBreathe #ClimateCrisis #ClimateActionNow #Scientistprotest #Stopfossilfuel #SaveOurPlanet #animals \n#michaeljackson #mj #explore #earth #nature #environment #wildlife #globalwarming", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CcXq-kaPUWs/", "\"2022\"", "Instagram"], [49.65644, -125.44139, "Vancouver Island", "A new research study has highlighted the 36 cities that will be underwater due to rising sea levels and frequent flooding within the next 80 years, and Vancouver made the list \ud83d\udc40\n\nThe research is based on elevation maps, and it compiles the 36 most populated or visited cities around the world that will be the first to be impacted.

Seagrass beds support a vibrant community of underwater creatures including sea turtles and many species of fish. They act as powerful carbon sinks, stabilize the ocean floor against erosion, and help filter out toxins from pollution with the help of mangroves and marshes. They also serve as a critical indicator of our ocean\u2019s health and are highly sensitive to changes in water quality.

The chalk from the White Cliffs of Dover has figured significantly in my work over the years. I love it as a classic drawing material and its role as a patriotic feature of our coastline. It literally marks the edge of England.\u00a0\n\nFor Island I\u2019ve painted the panes of glass of a greenhouse with white brushstrokes of cliff chalk, like chalking time. So the glasshouse becomes enclosed, inward looking, a vulnerable domain, a little England with a cliff-face veil. The Island in question is our own. In our time of Brexit, alienated from Europe, Britain is emptied out of Europeans just when we need them most. The spectre of the climate crisis is looming large: with crumbling coastlines and rising sea levels, things seem very precarious.\n\nThe light inside the greenhouse slowly pulses, breathing in and out like a lighthouse.
